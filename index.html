<h1 id="Name">History of the Name and Early Settlers</h1>
    <p id="history"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chillicothe was the name of several historic towns in Ohio. The word is from the Shawnee -- a
        central-North American American Indian in the Algonquian language family. "Chillicothe" was the name of a
        Shawnee clan. The principal leader of the Shawnee could only come from the Chillicothe clan. When a village was
        called "Chillicothe", it meant that it was home to the principal leader. It was the capital city of the Shawnee
        until the death of that person. Then the capital would move to the home village of the next person selected to
        lead. That village would then become Chillicothe.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Chillicothe was located on the site of the modern city of Piqua. Another was on the Scioto River south of
        Circleville at, or near, modern-day Westfall. A third Chillicothe was approximately three miles north of Xenia.
        When the Shawnee captured Simon Kenton in 1778, they brought him to this town. A fourth Chillicothe was at
        Frankfort along Paint Creek in Ross County. A fifth Chillicothe was at Hopetown, three miles north of
        present-day Chillicothe.

<h2 id="eighteen"> Pre-1800s Chillicothe </h2>
    <p class="Pre-Hundred"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern Chillicothe was Ohio's first state capital, but it was never the site of a former Shawnee town.
        In 1796, Nathaniel Massie laid out the town on the Scioto River. This community grew quickly, becoming a center
        of political influence within the Northwest Territory. Massie himself chose to settle in Chillicothe, along with
        other influential men in the territory, such as Thomas Worthington and Edward Tiffin. The town originally
        consisted of 456 lots. Massie promised to give away one hundred lots to the first settlers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By late 1796, several taverns, stores, and artisan shops had been built. In 1798, Ross County became
        incorporated with Chillicothe as the county seat. In 1800, the territorial capital moved to Chillicothe, and in
        1802 as Ohio moved toward statehood, the city hosted the Ohio Constitutional Convention. Chillicothe became
        Ohio's first state capital. The reasons why Chillicothe played such an important role in early state government
        were its central location as well as the prominent men, like Tiffin and Worthington, who resided in the town.
        The city continued as Ohio's capital until 1810, when state government moved to Zanesville. The capital returned
        to Chillicothe two years later, only to move to Columbus, forty-five miles to the north, in 1816.

    <h2>Other History of Chillicothe</h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was after the American Revolution that most European settlement came to this area. Migrants from Virginia and
        Kentucky moved west along the Ohio River in search of land. Chillicothe served as the capital of Ohio from the
        beginning of statehood in 1803 until 1810 when Zanesville became the capital for two years. The capital was moved
        to Zanesville as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. In 1812 the legislature moved the
        capital back to Chillicothe. In 1816 the state legislature voted to move the capital again, to Columbus to have it
        near the geographic center of the state, where it would be more accessible to most citizens.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Migrants to Chillicothe included free blacks, who came to a place with fewer restrictions than in the slave
        states. They created a vibrant community and aided runaway slaves coming north. As tensions increased prior to
        the breakout of the American Civil War, the free black community at Chillicothe maintained stations and aid to
        support refugees on the Underground Railroad. Slaves escaping from the South traveled across the Ohio River to
        freedom, and then up the Scioto River to get more distance from their former homes and slave hunters.
        White abolitionists aided the Underground Railroad as well.

<h2>1800s to Pre-World War One</h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1800s, Chillicothe became a busy economic center. While agriculture was the backbone of the local
        economy, other industries, especially papermaking, contributed to the town's prosperity. In 1831, the Ohio and
        Erie Canal connected Chillicothe more closely with other parts of the state, expanding the city's markets.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chillicothe entered the railroad age in 1852, when the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad entered the town. As the
        railroad acquired new owners, including the Cincinnati, Washington, and Baltimore Railroad Company and the
        Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, Chillicothe residents acquired even more markets for their goods.
        Usually, railroads quickly drove canal companies out of business. The principal reason for this was that
        railroads could transfer people and supplies at a much quicker rate and for a cheaper price than the canals.
        In the case of Chillicothe, however, the railroads and the canal peacefully coexisted. The railroads generally
        ran from the East to the West, while the canal handled business from the north to the south. The canal remained
        in operation until 1907, when a flood severely damaged it and forced it to close.

<h3 id="postWorld">Post World War One to The Current Era</h3>
    <p id="PtoCurrent">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World War I contributed immensely to Chillicothe's growth.
        In 1917, the United States government established Camp Sherman on the outskirts of the city. Within a few
        months, more than two thousand buildings had been built. They housed soldiers in training for duty in
        World War I. The city's population swelled from sixteen thousand people to approximately sixty thousand people
        practically overnight. Today, Camp Sherman does not exist. The United States government still owns the land and
        has established a Veterans Administration medical center. Three prisons also currently occupy parts of the site,
        as well as the Mound City National Monument, a National Park dedicated to preserving Hopewell American Indian
        earthworks. The Hopewell earthworks as well as other historic sites, including First Lady Lucy Hayes's home and
        Adena, the home of Thomas Worthington, have provided the community with an important tourism industry.

    <h3 id="Industry">Industry of Chillicothe and Census Data</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chillicothe businesses continue to produce paper, an industry that had its
        beginnings in the town in 1810.Chillicothe was the original home of the Mead Corporation, one of the
        United States' leading paper manufacturers. Daniel Mead established the company in 1890 in the city. During the
        twentieth century, additional industries moved to Chillicothe. Most importantly was the Kenworth Truck Company,
        which remains one of the main employers in the community today. Almost twenty-two thousand people called
        Chillicothe home in 2000.Many people worked in these various industries, while others commuted roughly one hour
        to Ohio's current capital, Columbus.
